# Multiplication_Quiz
Using java I created multiplication quiz for studnets. It uses Database class to know username and password of users. And with the help of admin user we can change number of questions that is given to students.  
Users:
1)  qaqa    pass: 123
2)  rafiq   pass: 123
3)  bob     pass: 123
4)  admin   pass: 123
